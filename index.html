               <p class="motorcycle-text">Although not necessarily a skill, I really enjoy riding my motorcycle. Seeing the old school Harley motorcycles with their deep sound was something that really interested me as a kid. I don't have a Harley (I don't have Harley money) but I do have 2018 Honda Rebel 500 and it's considered to be a beginner bike but beginner bike or not, it's a great bike and definitely a fun hobby of mine.</p>
